      "Story": "Mr. Chhitim Kessang, a 61-year-old male residing in Dehradun, self-referred to the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Jolly Grant, Dehradun, with complaints of chest pain, cough, and difficulty in breathing for the past six months. He was admitted, and an MRI of the chest, lung biopsy, CT thorax, and blood investigations were conducted. The results led to a diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer, and initial treatment was provided at the hospital. However, due to limited medical facilities, he was later referred to Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, for further treatment. In November 2020, he contacted the Tibetan Cancer Society for both physical and financial support. We then accompanied him to Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, where further tests—including blood tests, a lung biopsy, and a PET scan—confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. He was immediately started on treatment under the care of Dr. Sumit Goyal. To date, he has undergone 10 cycles of radiation therapy and 3 cycles of chemotherapy. In February 2021, he also underwent an ultrasound-guided nerve block due to frequent episodes of severe pain, despite the use of analgesics. As the patient had long wished to visit the pilgrimage site of Rewalsar (Tso Pema), we took him there to fulfill his last wish. During the visit, we explored the sacred sites together and stayed for about four days. He expressed deep gratitude and joy upon leaving Rewalsar. However, due to his physical weakness, he chose not to undergo further chemotherapy. At that time, all three staff nurses took turns caring for Pala Chhitim, including staying with him overnight. In time, Pala Chhitim passed away peacefully. We honored his final journey with deep respect and affection, offering him a heartfelt and compassionate farewell.",

He contacted the Tibetan Cancer Society in October 2020 during the pandemic, requesting emergency ambulance service to visit a hospital in Delhi for medical treatment. Immediately, our team responded and covered a distance of about 2176 km without any rest to provide the emergency ambulance service. We took the risk of handling a COVID-positive patient during such a critical time. Had they booked another ambulance, it would have cost them a substantial amount of money, but we provided the service free of charge. In fact, if it hadnt been for our ambulance, the patient may not have survived. During the pandemic, taking a patient to a private hospital was extremely risky, but after arriving in Delhi, our team immediately took him to the AIIMS Trauma Centre. He was admitted to the ICU for several days and, after one week, was transferred to the general ward for about three days. He was eventually discharged from the hospital and returned safely to his home after recovery. Had they arranged for another ambulance, the transportation cost from Bodhgaya to Delhi would have been exorbitant. We are proud that we could support him during this challenging time, ensuring his safe transport and treatment.",

Our team immediately responded and traveled for about 24 hours continuously in our ambulance vehicle, covering a distance of 952 km without any rest to provide emergency ambulance service to the patient. Had they booked another ambulance, it would have cost them around Rs 10,000–20,000, but we provided the service free of charge. Upon arriving in Delhi, we took her to the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, where a physician advised that she required a colostomy. Seeking a second opinion, we then took her to Fortis Hospital, where Dr. Amit Javed, a gastro-onco surgeon, prescribed medication. After taking the prescribed medicines for a few days, her condition improved, her complaints subsided, and her bowel patterns became regular. We followed up with a visit to Fortis Hospital, where the physician confirmed that surgery was not required at that time. However, he mentioned that if she experienced intestinal obstruction in the future, surgery might be necessary. Thanks to our ambulance service, we were able to provide timely medical care without delay. She later returned home, feeling relieved from her symptoms.",

      "Story": "On the evening of 15th March 2023, the Tibetan Cancer Society (TCS) Director, along with ambulance driver Mr. Tashi Topgyal and Nurse Ms. Tenzin Dekyong, embarked on an urgent emergency rescue mission. The journey commenced from the TCS office in Delhi to the STNM Hospital in Gangtok, Sikkim — a distance of over 1,500 kilometres. The ambulance set out in the evening of 15th March, navigating through the Lucknow Highway and crossing multiple states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal, before finally entering Sikkim by the evening of 16th March. The team operated on rotational driving shifts between the TCS Director and the ambulance driver, without rest, to ensure continuous movement. By 3:00 a.m. on 17th March, the ambulance successfully reached STNM Hospital in Gangtok. During the journey, the team was informed that the patients condition had deteriorated further. Upon medical evaluation the following day and consultation with Dr. Yougyal, it was sadly confirmed that the patients liver condition had worsened significantly. The patient was placed on a ventilator, rendering it too risky to continue with transportation to Delhi. With a unanimous decision from the patients family and the attending doctors, it was agreed not to proceed with the transfer. Though disheartening, it was ultimately the most medically sound decision. In consultation with our TCS team members and doctors, we spoke with and consoled the patients family regarding the decision. Given the critical circumstances, it was the most appropriate course of action. TCS assured them that theyve done their best. As the TCS team prepared to return to Delhi, the ambulance encountered severe mechanical issues, including damage to the wheel system. At this critical juncture, a Ladakhi Amala (Sikkim) and her family provided remarkable hospitality and assistance. They offered the team shelter, warm meals, and comfort without hesitation. Taking full responsibility, they even arranged for the damaged ambulance to be sent to Siliguri for urgent repairs. During this time, generous support was also extended by Dr. Yougyal, Cho Karma, and a local team of mechanics in Sikkim. The patient’s son kindly offered to bear the full cost of repairs, a gesture deeply appreciated by the TCS team, though politely declined. Although the primary mission to transport the patient to Delhi could not be completed, the TCS team remains proud of their effort and dedication. Despite the physical toll — with minimal rest and sleep — the mission was pursued with sincere commitment to the cause. In the spirit of service, TCS publicly announced through social media and community groups that the ambulance would be available free of charge for future critical patients from Sikkim requiring transportation to Delhi, regardless of ethnicity. The mission, though marked by unforeseen challenges, stands as a testament to the unwavering commitment of the Tibetan Cancer Society to serve those in need.",

The donation ceremony took place at the TCV Day School in Samyeling Tibetan Colony, Delhi. The donation was prompted by Rinpoche's deep concern regarding the severe conditions during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, which originated in Wuhan, China. During this period, India faced critical shortages, including insufficient wood for cremating the bodies of those deceased people. The ambulance, described as a modern, standard emergency vehicle equipped with all necessary facilities for saving lives in emergency situations, was donated with the hope of alleviating some of these emergency situations and reducing casualties. Mr. Tsultrim Dorje, Chairman of the Tibetan Cancer Society, expressed gratitude to the Lelung Charitable Foundation and Kyabje Lelung Rinpoche on behalf of their organization and the entire Tibetan community. He explained the importance and benefits of ambulance services during emergency situations and noted that the Tibetan Cancer Society now has two ambulances—one stationed in Mysore city to serve four Tibetan settlements in South India, and the newly donated vehicle that will remain permanently in Delhi. The ceremony was attended by representatives from Tibetan NGOs and the Samyeling Tibetan Colony's representative. Former Deputy Speaker of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, Acharya Yeshi Phuntsok, attended as a special guest. The Tibetan Cancer Society also presented certificates to volunteers and donors who had provided assistance during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the donation ceremony, Lelung Rinpoche expressed his foundation's aspirations to launch extensive construction projects in Delhi for homeless Tibetan youth, aimed at preserving their religious culture and traditions while preventing cultural dispersion. Rinpoche acknowledged that while these plans have not yet been implemented, he hopes they will be realized in the future.
