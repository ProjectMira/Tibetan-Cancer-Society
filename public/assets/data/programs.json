These \"Invisible\" members faced acute hunger, poverty, and lack of access to basic needs. Over two months, the project provided nutritious two-time meals daily to over 100 underprivileged people, helping boost their immunity and protect them from the virus. It also created opportunities for stranded youth to volunteer and earn wages, easing their financial burdens during difficult times. Today, the project has grown into a broader food charity drive, extending support to disadvantaged Indian destitute, poor patients seeking medical care at government hospitals, daily wagers, and others in need. With the help of generous donors, meals are provided regularly, often sponsored in honor of birthdays, death anniversaries, and other significant occasions. Meals for Invisible continues to serve as a vital lifeline, restoring dignity and hope to those society often forgets.",
