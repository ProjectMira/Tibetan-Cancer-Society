These services were designed to provide essential healthcare and support to the large number of devotees attending this spiritually significant event. The medical team, consisting of two doctors (a physician and a gynecologist), two physiotherapists, and ten nurses, was fully equipped to offer a wide range of healthcare services. Their presence ensured that attendees had access to immediate medical assistance, as well as ongoing healthcare support throughout the event. The camp also provided emergency ambulance services, with advanced life support capabilities to handle any critical situations that might arise during the teachings. Additionally, free medicines were made available to all attendees, ensuring that both devotees and the local community received the medical care they needed without financial burden. This health camp aimed to address the immediate healthcare needs of the attendees, while also raising awareness about cancer prevention and treatment. It underscored the Tibetan Cancer Society's commitment to improving healthcare access for underprivileged communities and supporting individuals in need of critical medical services.",

Unlike previous projects, the Tibetan Cancer Society did not have doctors present during the camp, but shared their wisdom through audiovisual materials disseminated to the general public. The purpose of conducting the H-Pylori stool test was to detect the H-Pylori virus and prevent peptic ulcers, which could have led to stomach cancer if not diagnosed early. In the previous year, the Tibetan Cancer Society had supported twelve stomach cancer patients, out of whom 6 had died, 4 were under treatment, 2 were receiving palliative care, and 1 had been cured.",

The program included H. pylori screening, ECG tests, blood tests, and free general health consultations. Dr. K. B. Lingegowda, former Director of Kidwai Cancer Institute, played a key role in raising cancer awareness among the local Tibetan population. The success of the event was made possible by the collective effort of many individuals. Sincere appreciation was extended to The Tibet Fund for their financial support, and to Ms. Palden La, Secretary of the Sonamling Settlement Office, for her exceptional coordination. Gratitude was also expressed to Mr. Sangpo La, Manager of Namdrel Corporation, for providing the community hall and broadcasting the health talks; Mr. Norsang La and his team for video editing and advertisement; Mr. Pema Lhundup La, a school principal, for allowing the use of the schools primary health centre; and Mr. Karma La, Director of the Tibetan Primary Health Centre, for his continued guidance. Special thanks were given to Dr. Amit Javed, who not only consulted patients but also saved a life through timely surgical intervention. Dr. Lingegowda’s contribution in educating the public on cancer was highly valued. Nurse Tenzin Dolma La of Apollo Hospital volunteered selflessly throughout the camp, managing tasks from patient interpretation to stool testing and vitals monitoring. Ms. Tenzin Choenyi La, a medical student from Nepal, offered invaluable assistance in data management, patient supervision, and testing. Mr. Tenzin Thardot La of the Special Frontier Force supported the team with transportation and documentation. The Tibetan Cancer Society expressed heartfelt gratitude to all contributors, acknowledged both here and previously, for their noble service to the community.",

The camp featured a wide range of medical services, including consultations with specialists in orthopedics, ophthalmology, gynecology, ENT, radiation oncology, and general oncology. A major highlight of the event was the provision of H. pylori stool testing, which allowed for early detection of Helicobacter pylori—a bacterium linked to stomach infections and gastric cancer. This initiative provided participants with a valuable opportunity to identify and address potential health risks at an early stage. The central focus of the camp was to raise cancer awareness within the Tibetan community by educating attendees about the risks, early warning signs, preventive strategies, and available treatment options for cancer. The event emphasized the importance of early detection and routine health screenings, aiming to empower individuals with the knowledge necessary to make informed health decisions and reduce the incidence of late-stage diagnoses.",

The primary aim was to educate the public about cancer prevention, early detection, and available treatment options, while simultaneously raising funds to support cancer patients. Led by Mr. Tsultrim Dorjee, CEO of TCS, a team of five dedicated volunteers distributed educational pamphlets outlining key information on cancer risks, preventive measures, and the importance of regular screenings. A special stall was set up to offer H. pylori stool testing, enabling early detection of the bacterium associated with gastric issues and stomach cancer. In addition to providing free health education and testing services, the campaign actively promoted awareness of TCSs mission and the essential support it offers to cancer patients across the Tibetan community. To raise funds for patient care, the team encouraged donations and sold keychains and pop sockets, with all proceeds contributing directly to TCSs ongoing health initiatives. The campaign was successful in both raising public awareness and generating strong community support, exemplifying a united effort to advance cancer education, prevention, and patient assistance.",
