    "About Event": "On 4th February 2018, the Tibetan Cancer Society (TCS) commemorated World Cancer Day at the Tibetan Youth Hostel in Bangalore with a series of impactful activities aimed at raising cancer awareness among the Tibetan youth. The event actively engaged college students through various initiatives, including a spirited basketball match among student NGOs that emphasized the importance of physical fitness in cancer prevention. An open-air drawing initiative encouraged younger students to creatively express their understanding of cancer and its impact, aligning with the days awareness goals. In the evening, a comprehensive cancer awareness talk was delivered by a senior oncologist from HCG Cancer Centre, offering insights into prevention, early detection, and treatment. This was followed by a quiz based on the talk, fostering interactive learning among the attendees. The celebration revolved around the global theme for 2016:2018, “We Can. I Can.”, inspiring students to take individual and collective responsibility in the fight against cancer. Through these diverse and meaningful activities, TCS successfully empowered Tibetan youth to become proactive advocates for health and cancer awareness in their communities.",

In a gesture of deep respect, a Gratitude and Appreciation Campaign was conducted to honor the tireless contributions of AIIMS medical staff, coinciding with the 90th birthday celebration of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. TCS also organized a heartfelt gift distribution for paediatric cancer patients at AIIMS, offering toys and comforting items to uplift young spirits. Outside the AIIMS campus, a signature campaign engaged the public in demonstrating solidarity with cancer patients and healthcare workers. Additionally, an Appreciation Campaign recognized the dedication of TCS volunteers, whose continuous efforts have been crucial to the society’s mission. The 2025 observance stood as a powerful example of unity, compassion, and proactive education in the global battle against cancer.",
